## My short career

First things first, my name is Elia Geretto, I am Italian, as you can probably
tell from my surname, and I am currently completing my Master in Computer
Science at the [University of Trento][trento]. To be precise, I am part of the
[EIT Security and Privacy][eit] program and, as a consequence, I also studied
one year abroad, at the [University of Twente][twente], in the Netherlands.

Regarding my, short, academic career there is not much else to say, but I hope
that one day I will have fancy job titles and important achievements to add in
a page similar to this one.

The last thing I would like to add is that I am also a CTF player; I discovered
this activity thanks to the [THS team][ths] back in Twente, I really had some
fun weekends with them and I hope I will be able to continue playing also here
in Italy. Fortunately, I was able to enlist some friends.

## My probably short blog

I still do not know precisely what this blog will become: it may result in yet
another dead project sitting on my Raspberry Pi, like my old website, or I may
end up writing on it quite often, only time will tell I guess. What I can almost
certainly assure is that, if content will appear, it will be about Computer
Science, probably about IT security.

The main reason I decided to have a blog in the first place is to be able to
publish CTF writeups since the last time I wrote one for my team, I did not have
anywhere to publish it. As of now I am migrating from my old Pi2 to a new Pi3
and thus I decided to take the occasion to prepare all this. I also plan on
throwing online the description of some interesting projects I may do on my own,
if I have time left from my studies, but I am not promising regular updates.


## My not so short blog title

Well, I guess it is quite obvious that the MissingFantasyException title is a
lame joke about what my brain says when I try to come up with a name for
something. To tell the truth, I gave the same name to an old group chat during
my Bachelor, the name was mine and, while I was thinking about a title for this
blog, that memory came up. As a consequence, despite being a lame joke, it is
also a small tribute to my friends.


## Contacts

Regarding the means to contact me, my social network profiles are at the bottom
of each page and I will put my PGP key fingerprint down here. My email will not
be on this website, since it is quite easily retrievable and verifiable, by a
human, searching for my name on the [MIT PGP Public Key Server][pgp]. _Only the
worthy shall get it._ Feel free to write to me with comments, suggestions and
maybe spelling mistakes, I do not promise there will not be any.

My PGP fingerprint is: `E6A2 C263 8783 04FD 68D9 82D0 B2FC 5634 96A7 9DCF`
